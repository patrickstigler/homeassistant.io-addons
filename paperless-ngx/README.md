# Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, _less paper_.

Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) & [Paperless-ng](https://github.com/jonaswinkler/paperless-ng) projects and is designed to distribute the responsibility of advancing and supporting the project among a team of people. [Consider joining us!](#community-support)
