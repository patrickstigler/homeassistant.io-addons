### Gotenberg
A powerful document conversion service that:

### Apache Tika Server
A metadata extraction service that:
- Detects and extracts metadata from documents
- Provides structured text content extraction
- Integrates with Paperless-ngx for enhanced document processing

### Redis
A high-performance in-memory data store that:
- Provides caching and message broker functionality
- Required for Paperless-ngx operation
